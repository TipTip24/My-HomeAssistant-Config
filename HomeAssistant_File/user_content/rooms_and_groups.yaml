# Homekit Infused Groups List, You will have to fill in this file for auto-filling to work.
# Homekit Infused is based on this principle so you'd better fill this in. If you don't have
# entities for a certain group, do NOT delete the group, just remove the entities, including
# the dash '-'. Do NOT delete any of these groups! I have warned you!!!!!

# Note: Some things might seem unlogical (or it feels like you already have created that group)
# For everything is a reason, and if I ask you to put in the same entity in multiple groups then
# you should do this as the groups will be read by lovelace (and the majority of the interface will
# be built up accordingly)

# Groups 

## Rooms ##################################################################################################################################

  # If you have a light that has rgb as well as color_temp, choose the group on which settings you use the most.
  # E.g. your Philips bulb has both rgb and color_temp. You mostly use the color_temp settings of that specific bulb.
  # In this case put the light in the color_temp group. If you don't want presets at all put them in the default light group.

  # NOTE: DO NOT RENAME THE GROUPS! You can name rooms in the HKI Settings view. If you want room based views depending on floor level.
  # You must enter the entities in the correct rooms. Rooms 1-10 are assigned to the 1st floor, rooms 11-16 to the 2nd floor and rooms 17-20 to the 3d floor.
 
  # The first room shows you the example of how to fill in these groups, you can either use entities and separate them with comma's or you can use a list, your choice.
